# GPA-Calculator
Academic project that allows users to calculate their GPA across multiple semesters (Python).

This program calculates a user's GPA based on a series of inputs. This Python project can only be run in the terminal.
The user can calculate any number of classes during a given semester and will need to provide the class name, final grade, and credit hours.
The program will continue to run until the user decides they do not want to calculate anymore semesters. The main outputs are basic statistics (GPA, Credits, etc.) 
for each semester calculated and cumulative statistics if the semsster count exceeds one.
